Description: Set of functions for analyzing Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) force-distance curves. It allows to obtain the contact and unbinding points, perform the baseline correction, estimate the Young's modulus, fit up to two exponential decay function to a stress-relaxation / creep experiment, obtain adhesion energies. These operations can be done either over a single F-d curve or over a set of F-d curves in batch  mode.
